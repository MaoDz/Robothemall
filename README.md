# Robothemall

## How to play
Open your terminal and execute the command below
```
cd ~/github/Robothemall
make
./Robothemall
```

The commands for the first player are :
*Up / Down : Z/S
*Left / Right : Q/D
*Shoot : SpaceBar

For the second player :
*Up / Down : I/K
*Left / Right : J/L
*Shoot : Enter

## Work :



## Bugs :
- On our keyboards, the second player can not move and shoot if the key-shoot button is "O".
- Random double free, we can not use valgrind to find it, because it's not often and valgrind is making the game lag...

## Resources :
Font for the game over : from fontspace.com, Super legend Boy.
Sprite for the robot : RPG Maker sprite
